					<h2 class="secTitle" style="width:10em">Introduction</h2>
					<p>Five years ago, forward-thinking funders and stakeholders came together to ask one, powerful question:<br/><br/><span class="blue-em"><em>How can we accelerate the spread of innovative health practices that improve the lives of the poor?</em></span></p>
					<p>To answer this question, the Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) was launched with three main goals: identify health programs using market-based innovations in developing countries, analyze the trends and effects of their methods, and connect them to the funders, competitions, and local resources that could help them scale and serve more people, ultimately improving health outcomes.</p>

						<p class="fancy-quote">The CHMI approach combines information provision, analysis, research, and ‘learning’ activities that promote the improvement and adaptation of promising programs, policies and practices that provide better and more affordable care to the poor. </p>
						<p>This year, as we celebrate our five year anniversary, we wanted to share highlights of what we have accomplished and learned through the years.</p>
						<br />
						<h5 class="subheadW">Imroved access to information on health innovations through global online knowledge sharing.</h5>
						<p>After five years of intensive landscaping we have profiled over 1,400 programs from over 130 countries, and feature the most comprehensive repository of information on this topic. Our database has been accessed by close to 600,000 unique users, with 55% of visits coming from Lower-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Today, the database has been used in a variety of different ways – to identify programs for funding, to understand the landscape of innovations by governments, to connect with like-minded innovators, to spot new trends and promising practices, and as a research tool cited in over 160 publications.</p>
						<h5 class="subheadW">Increased the evidence base about health innovations.</h5>
						<p>One of the most critical gaps we have sought to address through CHMI is the lack of systematic evidence about ‘what works’ in health markets. We have made several investments to increase our understanding about which programs are showing promising results, as well as, what implementation barriers programs face. The CHMI Reported Results initiative and CHMI PLUS encourage hundreds of organizations to share their impact through CHMI. The CHMI database provides a rich source of information to synthesize and analyze data to better identify and understand developments in the growth and diffusion of specific types of business models. Today, the CHMI database has been used to develop nearly 40 unique research products from the CHMI team – ranging from our annual Highlights Reports to our IRIS Health Metrics toolkit.</p>
						<h5 class="subheadW">Facilitated a network of regional partners to capitalize on health innovations for national health priorities</h5>
						<img class="quote-right" alt="A meeting of CHMI and regional partners in Kenya in 2011" src="img/Kenya_meeting1.jpg" />
						<p>Much of CHMI’s global success is due to a global network of country-based organizations working to improve health markets. This network of partners works to understand the innovations in their region and to inform policy and practice about how to deliver improved services to the poor. CHMI’s partners have developed a number of country-level mechanisms to source and support programs – e.g., competitions, innovation hackathons, and pitch series aimed at fostering country level support to innovations amongst investors and policy makers. These locally driven efforts have generated new awareness of what works in health markets and sparked increased momentum around the potential of health innovations.</p>
						<h5 class="subheadW">Fostered improvement and adaptation of health innovations.</h5>
						<p>CHMI launched a number of initiatives, including the Learning Exchange (LE), and the Primary Care Learning Collaborative (PCLC), which released the Innovator’s Handbook for Primary Care: Voices from Leaders in the Field in February 2015, and the Adaptation Framework for Global Exchange of Innovation in order for innovators to build upon, adapt, or scale up existing business models.</p>
						<p class="quote-left fancy-quote">The evolution of CHMI has shown that while our activities resulting in the scale-up of individual innovations are necessary and important, the effects of connecting multiple organizations to governments and each other has a much greater impact on the broader innovation ecosystem.</p>
						<p>Programs point to the value of collaborative learning opportunities, and the utility of the lessons learned to be disseminated with the broader CHMI network, including the Innovator’s Handbook.</p>
						<h5 class="subheadW">Where we can go in the future…</h5>
						<p>There is immense value in supporting learning across multiple organizations to foster knowledge sharing, but the tools, methods, and lessons learned need to be adapted in order to ensure impact at the country-level and achieve system-level scale. CHMI hopes to foster market-shaping activities by examining what has worked in other markets to develop a roadmap or menu of actions. And in turn, the lessons and practices identified could serve as a roadmap for other countries addressing similar challenges or testing related approaches.</p>

					<h5 class="subheader2">The Five C’s of Vibrant Innovation Ecosystems</h5>
					<p>The Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) started in 2010 with a simple mandate: find health programs using market-based innovations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This information would then allow us to analyze the trends and effects of their methods, and connect them to the resources that can help them scale and serve more people - ultimately improving health outcomes. While the 600 innovations we documented in 2010 seemed comprehensive, today we host over 1,450 programs in our database, which continues to grow by the week.</p>

						<p>The application of innovative models in international development has captured the attention of program implementers, funders, researchers and policymakers alike. Numerous innovations have been conceived and launched, however, there are many obstacles to identifying and accelerating the spread of innovative policies and practices that improve the lives of the poor.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Throughout our five years documenting and tracking innovations across health, education, and water, sanitation and hygiene, we noted that there were few examples of programs reaching scale. Innovations have potential for impact, but many of them face challenges of quality, affordability and sustainability, which limit their potential to scale and adapt. We also noted promising models seeking to scale require iteration to learn and improve upon their practices, but the cost of learning can be steep, and available sources of funding do not always align with programs’ “learning” needs.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Results for Development Institute has launched a series of innovation platforms — including the Center for Health Market Innovations, the Center for Education Innovations, and Innovations in WASH — to address these critical challenges and find new approaches to creating system-level change and diffusing promising components of programs beyond scaling one or two organizations. Early on, we realized that our simple mandate translated into a very complex set of activities. When we set out to document innovative programs, we found that the tools available for obtaining and spreading information about innovations were lacking. There was little information on which innovations work well and “how and why” these models are working. And few steps had been made toward and obvious way of addressing these deficiencies.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>The evolution of our work in health, education and WASH has shown that while our activities resulting in the scale-up of individual innovations are necessary and important, the effects of connecting multiple organizations to funders, governments and each other has a much greater impact on the broader innovation ecosystem. We’ve learned a lot about what innovators and other actors need to drive successful innovations forward.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>The five C’s reflect the lessons we’ve learned in this process and the essential approaches for anyone working to transform promising innovations into opportunities for social change.</p>
						<ol class="bold-li">
							<li><h3 class="subheader2">Core Components</h3></li>
							<p>While we began documenting innovative models, we saw stakeholder demand for guidance to develop coordinated, comprehensive and long-term approaches that go beyond the effects of scaling one organization to create system-level change through the identification of proven practices and “core components,” such as the use of telemedicine to bridge access challenges or training of community health workers to deliver maternal health services.<br />Highlighting these “core components” of innovation, in addition to specific innovators that have applied this concept, can help adapt that innovation to a new context. CHMI has already launched some initial work in this area — for example, recognizing that many organizations and individuals want to find and adapt relevant promising practices from others.<br />Few program models, though, are replicable in their entirety. R4D has launched a framework that seeks to facilitate the transfer of innovation. Organizations are now using the R4D adaptation framework to better understand the steps necessary to adapt innovations to new contexts.</p>
							<li><h3 class="subheader2">Continuous Learning</h3></li>
							<p>In the process of understanding “what works” in innovation, we have learned that most programs are really still works in progress. Promising models seeking to scale require iteration to learn and improve upon their practices, but the cost of learning can be steep, and available sources of funding do not always align with programs’ learning needs.<br />We’ve supported such process by bringing multiple organizations together for face-to-face learning exchanges, which are designed to provide targeted learning opportunities for innovators. R4D also has a new approach to program monitoring, evaluation, and learning called the Learning Lab. R4D is working with select health and education programs to focus monitoring and evaluation efforts at an earlier stage of the program cycle, by putting structured learning, experimentation and feedback at the heart of program design, piloting and scale-up efforts.</p>
							<li><h3 class="subheader2">Co-Creation and Collaboration</h3></li>
							<p>Few existing opportunities allow programs themselves to take ownership of the learning process and work collaboratively with peers who face some of the same challenges and with funders looking to engage in the problem-solving process. To make true progress, we must engage collaboratively with innovators and across sectors.<br/>We have found that innovators — sometimes even people working on similar problems or models in the same city — don’t know each other. Collaborative networks bring together groups of innovators working on similar models to collectively problem-solve and publicly document their lessons.<br/>In the past year, we experimented with a group of primary care innovators who have now produced a primary care innovators handbook as a way to share tacit knowledge gained in the field. Other network examples include multisectoral groups seeking to address a particular problem through government and private sector collaboration.<br/>We have measured the great opportunity for people working on similar innovations to learn a lot from each other. The global institutions working with many innovators can be mediators to help them find each other and offer platforms for interaction.</p>
							<li><h3 class="subheader2">Country innovation partners</h3></li>
							<p>We work through a global network of country-based organizations. Our partners act as facilitators of key local and regional actors, carrying out the dual role of connecting programs to opportunities and encouraging system-level change. Our country innovation partners have added value at the country level in several distinct ways: raising awareness about the potential of innovations; creating large, in-country networks that leverage global learning and lower barriers to collaboration; leveraging our platforms, networks and other work to amplify the impact of their own and others’ efforts; and working with governments and funders to foster the uptake of promising innovations.<br/>As part of their work, partners have developed a number of country-level mechanisms to source and support programs, such as competitions, innovation hackathons and pitch series aimed at fostering country-level support to innovations among donors, investors and policymakers. These locally driven efforts have generated new awareness of what works and sparked increased momentum around the potential of innovations.</p>
							<li><h3 class="subheader2">Copycats</h3></li>
							<p>If we are truly ready to scale innovation and move beyond just a few organizations doing well, we need to create copycats. Currently, we are systematically identifying receptor sites through the lens of adaptation and replication of innovations.<br/>How do we find organizations that can be good copycats?  These organizations play a slightly different role than the initial innovators but are no less important in strengthening entire systems or industries that are able to engage with the government and other ecosystem players.<br/>We have found that to help countries build highly performing health and education systems that serve the poor, we need larger industries of providers that go beyond one or two successful organizations. Copycats should be encouraged as a way of promoting promising models and vibrant systems and industries.</p>
						</ol>
						<p>Our work over the past five years has taught us the importance of working directly with innovators, country and regional partners, researchers and governments to understand how innovations can gain success and get to scale. This group of stakeholders represents the sixth “C” of building vibrant innovation ecosystems — community. We hope you’ll join ours.</p>

					<p>CHMI provides free access to the world’s most comprehensive database of innovative health programs in developing countries, catalyzing new partnerships and opportunities to take organizations to scale. CHMI profiles programs that work in low- and middle- income countries and serve low-income communities, spanning a broad spectrum of service delivery, financing, regulatory, and process/product-oriented innovations. Each program is captured through a standardized profile documenting information about the program’s operational design, including health focus, targeted populations, funding sources, and where available, results to date.</p>
					<br />
					<p>This database is designed to increase collective understanding about the scale, scope, and results of innovative health approaches. The information is underpinned by a framework categorizing each innovation’s main ‘approach’ and standardizes the way information is collected and reported – including performance results where available. The database launched in July 2010 with an initial set of 600 profiled programs, and has evolved significantly since launch.</p>

						<h5 class="subheader2">Informing the Evolution of Health Markets</h5>
						<p>CHMI’s academic and research partnerships have resulted in many high-level analyses based on evidence collected from the CHMI database. Research often begins with a review of the programs profiled on CHMI’s database to identify emerging practices and compelling models. Practitioners and researchers then go further, consulting and interviewing program managers about their work to identify core elements of success. All projects aim to generate knowledge that can be rapidly integrated to improve outcomes. The information in the CHMI database has been cited in over <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=healthmarketinnovations.org&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C9&as_sdtp="><strong>120 academic publications</strong></a>, and has also been used to understand the ecosystem of health market innovations globally.

					<h3></h3>
					<p>CHMI brings domestic organizations together to create an international network that champions the strength of private sector providers, and that to stimulates health innovations for national health priorities.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Globally, private innovators often work in silos, unable to access local knowledge, resources, and organizations that can help them improve, replicate and scale. Governments are increasingly looking for opportunities to engage with the private sector, but lack the on-the-ground knowledge, connections and technical expertise to begin new partnerships.</p>

					<h5 class="subheader2">Building Strong In-Country Networks</h5>
					<p>Over the past five years, CHMI has worked with over twenty in-country partners around the globe, each bringing their unique expertise to CHMI’s ever-growing network of prominent domestic leaders committed to improving healthcare for the poor worldwide. CHMI’s partners act as facilitators of key local and regional actors, carrying out the dual role of connecting programs to opportunities and pressing for systems-level change.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Building an in-country CHMI network has provided innovators with a place to go to brainstorm questions such as how to scale, how to replicate, how to diffuse and disseminate their ideas, and how to pass along lessons learned.</p>

					<h5 class="subheader2">Facilitating the ability to scale</h5>
						<div class="small-10 columns right">
							<p>The Philippines Institute for Development Studies designed the Philippine Health Market Innovation awards, a program that highlighted more than 40 promising delivery, financing, and technology solutions. Judges representing business, academia, and government debated the merits of the various health programs, ultimately awarding initiatives they felt were pro-poor, sustainable, innovative, and had demonstrated real impact.</p>
							<br />
							<p>After meeting Oscar Picazo and Valerie Ulep of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies through the CHMI partner network and learning about the Philippine Health Market Innovation awards, Dr. Muyi Aina was inspired to create the Health Innovation Competition. Housed within the Private Sector Health Alliance, a sustainable platform aimed at unlocking the potential of Nigeria’s private sector, the competition has 46 entrants and counting. Solina also fostered the creation of a Health Hackathon—three winners are enrolled in the iDea Hub, an incubator housed in the Ministry of Information and Community Technology. </p>

					<div>Wielding considerable data on promising practices, models with evidence, and operational lessons, CHMI works with regional and global partners to translate this knowledge to practice. We also help innovative organizations access opportunities to grow. CHMI links innovators with learning, operational, and funding opportunities – all means to extend access to quality healthcare in low-income communities.</div>
					<p>CHMI launched the Primary Care Learning Collaborative (PCLC) and the Learning Exchange to provide targeted learning opportunities for innovations, allowing them to improve and grow their models. These initiatives also feed their broader learnings back into the database and knowledge products to share best practices with the broader CHMI community.</p>
