					<p class="text-justify">In the past five years, a broad swath of organizations has turned their focus to the exciting innovations in privately delivered healthcare for developing countries. With great potential for success and impact, these innovative programs have become uniquely celebrated in the atmosphere of TED talks, think tanks, and innovation competitions. In 2010, however, the social entrepreneurship bubble had not yet been inflated, and awareness of innovative programs working to improve health in developing countries was low. Without a central repository of information, the organizations seeking to support developing enterprises were unable to identify the innovations that existed and were achieving results. </p>

					<h3 class="subheader2">The Five C’s of Vibrant Innovation Ecosystems</h3>
					<a class="expander readmore2" href="#">Read the Forward</a>
					<div class="content">
						<p>The Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) started in 2010 with a simple mandate: find health programs using market-based innovations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This information would then allow us to analyze the trends and effects of their methods, and connect them to the resources that can help them scale and serve more people - ultimately improving health outcomes. While the 600 innovations we documented in 2010 seemed comprehensive, today we boast a staggering 1,430 programs in our database, which continues to grow by the week.</p>
						<p>Early on, we realized that our simple mandate translated into a very complex set of activities. When we set out to document innovative programs, we found that the tools available for obtaining and spreading information about innovations were lacking. There was little information on which innovations work well, and “how and why” these models are working. And few steps had been made toward and obvious way of addressing these deficiencies.</p>
						<p>The evolution of CHMI has shown that while our activities resulting in the scale-up of individual innovations are necessary and important, the effects of connecting multiple organizations to governments and each other has a much greater impact on the broader innovation ecosystem.</p>
						<p>We’ve learned a lot about what innovators and public health systems need to drive successful innovations forward. The “five C’s” reflect the lessons we’ve learned in this process, and are essential approaches for anyone working to transform promising innovations into opportunities for social change.</p>
						<ol>
							<li><h4>Core Components</h4></li>
							<p>While we began documenting innovative health models, we saw stakeholder demand for guidance to develop coordinated, comprehensive, and long-term approaches that go beyond the effects of scaling one organization to create system-level change through the identification of proven practices and “core components.” For example: the use of telemedicine to bridge access challenges or training of community health workers to deliver maternal health services. Highlighting these “active ingredients” of innovation, in addition to specific innovators that have applied this concept, can help adapt that innovation to a new context. CHMI has already launched some initial work in this area – for example, recognizing that many organizations and individuals want to find and adapt relevant promising practices from others, but few program models are replicable in their entirety, CHMI has launched a framework that seeks to facilitate the transfer of innovation. Organizations are now using the CHMI Adaptation Framework, developed through our analysis of the many components and ingredients of the 1,400 programs in our programs database, to better understand the steps necessary to adapt innovations to new contexts.</p>
							<li><h4>Continuous Learning</h4></li>
							<p>In the process of understanding “what works” in innovation, we have learned that most programs are really still works in progress. Promising models seeking to scale require iteration to learn and improve upon their practices – but the cost of learning can be steep, and available sources of funding do not always align with programs’ learning needs. We’ve supported this process by bringing multiple organizations together for face-to-face Learning Exchanges – designed to provide targeted learning opportunities for innovators. The Rockefeller and World Bank-supported Joint Learning Network for UHC is another example of a model of systematic practitioner to practitioner learning and problem-solving methodology that aims to capture practical lessons in formats ready to share with other innovators.</p>
							<li><h4>Co-Creation and Collaboration</h4></li>
							<p>Few existing opportunities allow programs themselves to take ownership of the learning process and work collaboratively with peers who face some of the same challenges. To make true progress, we must engage collaboratively with innovators and across sectors. We have found that innovators – sometimes even people working on similar problems or models in the same city - don’t know each other.  Collaborative networks bring together groups of innovators working on similar models to collectively problem solve and publicly document their lessons. In the past year, we experimented with a group of primary care clinic chains who have now produced a Primary Care Innovators Handbook as a way to share tacit knowledge gained in the field. Other network examples include multi-sectoral groups seeking to address a particular problem through government and private sector collaboration. We have measured the great opportunity for people working on similar innovations to learn a lot from each other. The global institutions working with many innovators can be mediators to help them find each other and offer platforms for interaction.</p>
							<li><h4>Country innovation partners</h4></li>
							<p>CHMI works through a global network of country-based organizations. CHMI’s partners act as facilitators of key local and regional actors, carrying out the dual role of connecting programs to opportunities and encouraging system-level change. CHMI‘s regional innovation partners have added value at the country level in several distinct ways: (1) raising awareness about the potential of health innovations, (2) creating large, in-country networks that leverage the CHMI database and lower barriers to collaboration, (3) leveraging CHMI and other work to amplify the impact of their own and others’ efforts, (4) working with governments to foster the uptake of promising innovations. As part of their work, partners have developed a number of country-level mechanisms to source and support programs – e.g., competitions, innovation hackathons, and pitch series aimed at fostering country level support to innovations amongst investors and policy makers. These locally driven efforts have generated new awareness of what works in health markets and sparked increased momentum around the potential of health innovations.</p>
							<li><h4>Copycats</h4></li>
							<p>If we are truly ready to scale innovation and move beyond just a few organizations doing well, we need to create copycats. Currently, we are systematically identifying receptor sites through the lens of adaptation and replication of innovations. How do we find organizations that can be good copycats?  These organizations play a slightly different role than the initial innovators, but are no less important in strengthening health systems. We have found that to help organizations make the jump from isolated innovators to the larger segment of early adopters, it is necessary to bring programs together to share triumphs, failures, and pathways to collaboration.</p>
						</ol>
						<p>While our growing database of more than 1,400 health innovations relies upon technology and data to provide insights into what’s out there, our past five years have taught us the importance of working directly with innovators, country and regional-level hubs, researchers and governments to understand how innovations can gain success and get to scale. This group of stakeholders represents the 6th “C” of building vibrant innovation ecosystems – community. We hope you’ll join ours.</p>

					<h3 class="subheader">A Global Platform for Innovations in Health</h3>
					<p>CHMI provides free access to the world’s most comprehensive database of innovative health programs in developing countries, catalyzing new partnerships and opportunities to take organizations to scale. CHMI profiles programs that work in low- and middle- income countries and serve low-income communities, spanning a broad spectrum of service delivery, financing, regulatory, and process/product-oriented innovations. Each program is captured through a standardized profile documenting information about the program’s operational design, including health focus, targeted populations, funding sources, and where available, results to date.</p>
					<br />
					<p>This database is designed to increase collective understanding about the scale, scope, and results of innovative health approaches. The information is underpinned by a framework categorizing each innovation’s main ‘approach’ and standardizes the way information is collected and reported – including performance results where available. The database launched in July 2010 with an initial set of 600 profiled programs, and has evolved significantly since launch.</p>
					<br />
					<h3 class="subheader">Database at a Glance</h3>
					<p>As of June 2015, CHMI has identified over <strong>1400 programs</strong> in more than <strong>130 countries</strong> around the world. Here, we highlight some of the interesting trends of this database. To learn more, explore the database at <a><strong>HealthMarketInnovations.org/programs</strong></a>.</p>

						<h4>Informing the Evolution of Health Markets</h4>
						<p>CHMI’s academic and research partnerships have resulted in many high-level analyses based on evidence collected from the CHMI database. Research often begins with a review of the programs profiled on CHMI’s database to identify emerging practices and compelling models. Practitioners and researchers then go further, consulting and interviewing program managers about their work to identify core elements of success. All projects aim to generate knowledge that can be rapidly integrated to improve outcomes. The information in the CHMI database has been cited in over <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=healthmarketinnovations.org&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C9&as_sdtp="><strong>120 academic publications</strong></a>, and has also been used to understand the ecosystem of health market innovations globally.
