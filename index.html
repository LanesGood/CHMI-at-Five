						<h2 class="secTitle">Introduction</h2>
						<p class="text-justify">In the past five years, a broad swath of organizations has turned their focus to the exciting innovations in privately delivered healthcare for developing countries. With great potential for success and impact, these innovative programs have become uniquely celebrated in the atmosphere of TED talks, think tanks, and innovation competitions. In 2010, however, the social entrepreneurship bubble had not yet been inflated, and awareness of innovative programs working to improve health in developing countries was low. Without a central repository of information, the organizations seeking to support developing enterprises were unable to identify the innovations that existed and were achieving results. </p>

						<h3 class="subheader">A Global Platform for Innovations in Health</h3>
						<p>CHMI provides free access to the world’s most comprehensive database of innovative health programs in developing countries, catalyzing new partnerships and opportunities to take organizations to scale. CHMI profiles programs that work in low- and middle- income countries and serve low-income communities, spanning a broad spectrum of service delivery, financing, regulatory, and process/product-oriented innovations. Each program is captured through a standardized profile documenting information about the program’s operational design, including health focus, targeted populations, funding sources, and where available, results to date.</p>
						<p>This database is designed to increase collective understanding about the scale, scope, and results of innovative health approaches. The information is underpinned by a framework categorizing each innovation’s main ‘approach’ and standardizes the way information is collected and reported – including performance results where available. The database launched in July 2010 with an initial set of 600 profiled programs, and has evolved significantly since launch.</p>

							<h4>Informing the Evolution of Health Markets</h4>
							<p>CHMI’s academic and research partnerships have resulted in many high-level analyses based on evidence collected from the CHMI database. Research often begins with a review of the programs profiled on CHMI’s database to identify emerging practices and compelling models. Practitioners and researchers then go further, consulting and interviewing program managers about their work to identify core elements of success. All projects aim to generate knowledge that can be rapidly integrated to improve outcomes. The information in the CHMI database has been cited in over 120 academic publications, and has also been used to understand the ecosystem of health market innovations globally.</p>
