                    <div class="content acs">
                        <!--Intro Text-->

                        <p>The <strong>CHMI approach combines information provision, analysis, research, connections and ‘learning’ activities</strong> that promote the improvement and adaptation of promising programs, policies and practices that show promise in providing better and more affordable care to the poor.</p>

                        <p>This year, as we celebrate our five year anniversary, we wanted to share highlights of what we have accomplished, what we have learned through the years, and where we hope to go next.</p><br>

                        <h4 class="subheadW">Improved access to information on the universe of health innovations</h4>

                        <p>After five years of intensive landscaping we have profiled more than 1,450 health programs, policies and practices from over 130 countries, making the CHMI database the most comprehensive global online repository of information on health innovations. Our online database has been used over 1 million times, with over half of the visits coming from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Today, the database has been used in a variety of different ways – to identify programs for funding, to understand the landscape of programmatic options by governments, to connect with like-minded innovators, to spot new trends and promising practices, and as a research tool cited in over 120 publications.</p>

                        <h4 class="subheadW">Increased the evidence base to promote learning and collaboration in health innovation</h4>

                        <p>One of the most critical gaps we have sought to address through CHMI is the lack of systematic evidence on health markets and the individual programs operating within them. We have made several investments to increase our understanding about which programs are showing promising results, as well as what implementation challenges programs face. The CHMI <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/about/reported-results">Reported Results</a> initiative and <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/about/CHMIPlus">CHMI PLUS</a> encourage hundreds of organizations to share their results and impact through CHMI. Increasing transparency about programmatic results promotes an environment of learning and collaboration across our network of innovators. The more programs share, the more CHMI and others can engage with them with targeted support such as evaluation and learning services.</p><br>

                        <p>In addition, the CHMI database provides a rich source of data to better understand developments in the growth and diffusion of specific types of business models – e.g., models that improve maternal and child health or increase access to primary care. Today, the CHMI database has been used to develop nearly 40 unique research and analytic products from the CHMI team and our collaborators – ranging from our <a href="C:/Users/lgoodman/Downloads/healthmarketinnovations.org/Highlights">annual Highlights Reports</a> providing an overview of trends in health innovation, to our partnership with the Global Impact Investing Network to develop standardized <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/content/health-metrics">health metrics</a> for innovators, to our in-depth research on the role of <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/sites/default/files/IP%20Study_Summary%20for%20HSR_10%2010%2010.pdf">Informal Providers in Mixed Health Systems</a>.</p>

                        <h4 class="subheadW">Collaborated with a network of country-based partners to capitalize on health innovations for national health priorities</h4><img alt="A meeting of CHMI and regional partners in Kenya in 2011" class="quote-right" src="img/Kenya_meeting1.jpg">

                        <p class="text-justify">Our global network of country-based organizations has facilitated some of CHMI's most exciting activities. This network of partners works to understand the innovations in their country and inform policy and practice about how innovations can be harnessed to improve health services for the poor. CHMI’s partners have developed a number of country-level mechanisms to source and support programs – e.g., competitions, innovation hackathons, and pitch series aimed at fostering country level support to innovations amongst donors, investors and policymakers. Our partners have collaborated with policymakers to promote increased government engagement of private sector providers and created broad-based platforms for key health systems stakeholders that promote alignment around how to capitalize on the innovations in their country. These <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/blog/spotlight-access-health-facilitating-public-private-partnerships-health">locally driven efforts</a> have sparked increased momentum around the potential of how health innovations can be supported by governments and others to advance countries’ national health priorities.</p>

                        <h4 class="subheadW">Supported the improvement and adaptation of health innovations.</h4>

                        <p>Early on, CHMI recognized the need for user-driven learning opportunities so that programs could work with like-minded peers to co-create solutions to common challenges, adapt promising practices from others, and iterate and experiment with new approaches. The overarching goal was to improve their models and make them more scalable and sustainable. To achieve this, CHMI launched the Learning Exchange and <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/document/chmi-primary-care-learning-collaborative-overview">Primary Care Learning Collaborative</a> to help innovators build upon existing models and adapt promising practices. These initiatives have promoted extensive cross-border collaboration resulting in valuable insights and practical recommendations for improvement and adaptation.</p>

                        <p class="quote-left fancy-quote">The evolution of our work has taught us that there is great potential in connecting promising innovations to governments through policy and financing mechanisms, global collaborators working to improve health systems, and each other with the goal of achieving amplified impact on health markets and promoting the diffusion of “what works” beyond individual programs and contexts.</p>

                        <p>Programs point to the value of collaborative learning opportunities, and the utility of the lessons learned in the <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/Handbook">Innovator’s Handbook</a>.</p>

                        <h4 class="subheadW">Where we can go in the future…</h4>

                        <p>In early 2015, CHMI underwent a strategic review of its work of the past five years. The process was conducted by an independent evaluator in close collaboration with our funders, UK Aid and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). This strategic review provided us with a valuable opportunity for self-reflection and open discussion about CHMI’s genesis and original objectives, accomplishments, lessons learned, and potential future directions. A key takeaway from the review was that CHMI continues to be a highly relevant platform with important accomplishments over the past five years which can be leveraged to achieve even greater impact in the future. Read our founder Gina Lagomarsino's article on <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/the-5-c-s-of-innovation-ecosystems-86639">The Five C's of Innovation Ecosystems"</a> to learn how we're applying the lessons of CHMI across the multiple innovation platforms at Results for Development. As our work has evolved continuously since CHMI’s launch, we expect our activities will continue to evolve in the future as we facilitate innovations to improve health markets around the world. In the near-term, our new portfolio of “learning” activities that promote the improvement and adaptation of promising programs are already reaching new communities of innovators and global partners.

                    <p>In subsequent years, partners deepened their engagement – e.g., launched innovation awards, fostered connections to potential funders, and showcased promising models to policymakers. Most recently, partners have become more directly engaged in <strong>fostering public-private dialogue and serving as catalysts and advisers to country efforts to steward mixed health systems.</strong> In addition, they have connected to form a broader community, learning from each other and adopting the CHMI mission, and in some cases, raising additional funding to carry forward related activities.</p>

                        <p>CHMI's learning initiatives support collaborative knowledge sharing among promising innovations. Two of the main initiatives include the <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/document/chmi-primary-care-learning-collaborative-overview">Primary Care Learning Collaborative</a> and the <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/learning-exchange">Learning Exchange</a>. These programs provide targeted learning opportunities for innovators, allowing them to improve and consider how to scale or adapt their models. This also builds on <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/activeingredient">new research</a> CHMI has developed in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) to support innovation translation and adaptation to new contexts.</p>

                        <p>In 2013, the Primary Care Learning Collaborative served as a peer-learning network that facilitated knowledge-sharing, joint problem-solving, and the collaborative development of promising approaches among five organizations employing chain and franchise models to deliver primary health care to low-income communities in Kenya, Burundi, and India. These organizations included: Access Afya, LifeNet International, Penda Medical Center, Ross Clinics, and Swasth India.</p><br>

                        <p>In February of 2015 CHMI released the <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/Handbook">Primary Care Innovator's Handbook: Voices from Leaders in the Field</a> as the culminating product of a year’s worth of activities by the Primary Care Collaborative. Written by implementers themselves, this Handbook shares knowledge in an open and ongoing conversation about concrete tools, approaches, solutions, successes, and failures, with the ultimate goal of helping organizations to scale and to overcome challenges.</p>
