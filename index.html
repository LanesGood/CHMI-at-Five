					<h2 class="secTitle" style="width:10em">Introduction</h2>
					<p>Five years ago, forward-thinking funders and stakeholders came together to ask one, powerful question:<br/><br/><span class="blue-em"><em>How can we accelerate the spread of innovative health practices that improve the lives of the poor?</em></span></p>
					<p>To answer this question, the Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) was launched with three main goals: identify health programs using market-based innovations in developing countries, analyze the trends and effects of their methods, and connect them to the funders, competitions, and local resources that could help them scale and serve more people, ultimately improving health outcomes.</p>

						<p class="fancy-quote">The CHMI approach combines information provision, analysis, research, and ‘learning’ activities that promote the improvement and adaptation of promising programs, policies and practices that provide better and more affordable care to the poor. </p>
						<p>This year, as we celebrate our five year anniversary, we wanted to share highlights of what we have accomplished and learned through the years.</p>
						<br />
						<h5 class="subheadW">Imroved access to information on health innovations through global online knowledge sharing.</h5>
						<p>After five years of intensive landscaping we have profiled over 1,400 programs from over 130 countries, and feature the most comprehensive repository of information on this topic. Our database has been accessed by close to 700,000 unique users, with 55% of visits coming from Lower-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Today, the database has been used in a variety of different ways – to identify programs for funding, to understand the landscape of innovations by governments, to connect with like-minded innovators, to spot new trends and promising practices, and as a research tool cited in over 160 publications.</p>
						<h5 class="subheadW">Increased the evidence base about health innovations.</h5>
						<p>One of the most critical gaps we have sought to address through CHMI is the lack of systematic evidence about ‘what works’ in health markets. We have made several investments to increase our understanding about which programs are showing promising results, as well as, what implementation barriers programs face. The CHMI <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/about/reported-results">Reported Results</a> initiative and <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/about/CHMIPlus">CHMI PLUS</a> encourage hundreds of organizations to share their impact through CHMI. The CHMI database provides a rich source of information to synthesize and analyze data to better identify and understand developments in the growth and diffusion of specific types of business models. Today, the CHMI database has been used to develop nearly 40 unique research products from the CHMI team – ranging from our <a href="C:\Users\lgoodman\Downloads\healthmarketinnovations.org\Highlights">annual Highlights Reports</a> to our <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/content/health-metrics">IRIS Health Metrics toolkit</a>.</p>
						<h5 class="subheadW">Facilitated a network of regional partners to capitalize on health innovations for national health priorities</h5>
						<img class="quote-right" alt="A meeting of CHMI and regional partners in Kenya in 2011" src="img/Kenya_meeting1.jpg" />
						<p>Much of CHMI’s global success is due to a global network of country-based organizations working to improve health markets. This network of partners works to understand the innovations in their region and to inform policy and practice about how to deliver improved services to the poor. CHMI’s partners have developed a number of country-level mechanisms to source and support programs – e.g., competitions, innovation hackathons, and pitch series aimed at fostering country level support to innovations amongst investors and policy makers. These <a href="http://healthmarketinnovations.org/blog/spotlight-access-health-facilitating-public-private-partnerships-health">locally driven efforts</a> have generated new awareness of what works in health markets and sparked increased momentum around the potential of health innovations.</p>
						<h5 class="subheadW">Fostered improvement and adaptation of health innovations.</h5>
						<p>CHMI launched a number of initiatives, including the Learning Exchange (LE), and the Primary Care Learning Collaborative (PCLC), which released the Innovator’s Handbook for Primary Care: Voices from Leaders in the Field in February 2015, and the Adaptation Framework for Global Exchange of Innovation in order for innovators to build upon, adapt, or scale up existing business models.</p>
						<p class="quote-left fancy-quote">The evolution of CHMI has shown that while our activities resulting in the scale-up of individual innovations are necessary and important, the effects of connecting multiple organizations to governments and each other has a much greater impact on the broader innovation ecosystem.</p>
						<p>Programs point to the value of collaborative learning opportunities, and the utility of the lessons learned to be disseminated with the broader CHMI network, including the Innovator’s Handbook.</p>
						<h5 class="subheadW">Where we can go in the future…</h5>
						<p>There is immense value in supporting learning across multiple organizations to foster knowledge sharing, but the tools, methods, and lessons learned need to be adapted in order to ensure impact at the country-level and achieve system-level scale. CHMI hopes to foster market-shaping activities by examining what has worked in other markets to develop a roadmap or menu of actions. And in turn, the lessons and practices identified could serve as a roadmap for other countries addressing similar challenges or testing related approaches.</p>

					<p>CHMI provides free access to the world’s most comprehensive database of health market innovations in developing countries, serving as a backbone for in-country activities to catalyze new partnerships and opportunities to take promising innovations to scale. CHMI profiles programs that work in low- and middle- income countries and serve poor communities, spanning a broad spectrum of service delivery, financing, regulatory, and process/product-oriented innovations. Each program is captured through a standardized profile documenting information about the program’s operational design, including health focus, targeted populations, funding sources, and where available, results and impact to date. The database is designed to increase our collective understanding about the scale, scope, and results of innovative health programs with the goal of promoting the diffusion and uptake of promising practices.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The database launched in July 2010 with an initial set of 600 profiled programs, and has evolved significantly since launch.</p>

						<p>CHMI’s academic and research partnerships have resulted in many high-level analyses based on evidence collected from the CHMI database. Research often begins with a review of the programs profiled on CHMI’s database to identify emerging practices and compelling models. Practitioners and researchers then go further, consulting and interviewing program managers about their work to identify core elements of success. All projects aim to generate knowledge that can be rapidly integrated to improve outcomes. The information in the CHMI database has been cited in over <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=healthmarketinnovations.org&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C9&as_sdtp="><strong>120 academic publications</strong></a>, and has also been used to understand the ecosystem of health market innovations globally.

				<p>The Philippines Institute for Development Studies designed the Philippine Health Market Innovation awards, a program that highlighted more than 40 promising delivery, financing, and technology solutions. Judges representing business, academia, and government debated the merits of the various health programs, ultimately awarding initiatives they felt were pro-poor, sustainable, innovative, and had demonstrated real impact.</p>
				<br />
				<p>After meeting Oscar Picazo and Valerie Ulep of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies through the CHMI partner network and learning about the Philippine Health Market Innovation awards, Dr. Muyi Aina was inspired to create the Health Innovation Competition. Housed within the Private Sector Health Alliance, a sustainable platform aimed at unlocking the potential of Nigeria’s private sector, the competition has 46 entrants and counting. Solina also fostered the creation of a Health Hackathon—three winners are enrolled in the iDea Hub, an incubator housed in the Ministry of Information and Community Technology. </p>

					<p>Wielding considerable data on promising practices, models with evidence, and operational lessons, CHMI works with regional and global partners to translate this knowledge to practice. We also help innovative organizations access opportunities to grow. CHMI links innovators with learning, operational, and funding opportunities – all means to extend access to quality healthcare in low-income communities.</p>
					<p>CHMI launched the Primary Care Learning Collaborative (PCLC) and the Learning Exchange to provide targeted learning opportunities for innovations, allowing them to improve and grow their models. These initiatives also feed their broader learnings back into the database and knowledge products to share best practices with the broader CHMI community.</p>
